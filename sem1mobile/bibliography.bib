Journal = {{THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY}},

Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{1237-1258}},
Abstract = {{Research concerning mobile phones and financial services in developing
   countries has undergone rapid growth in recent years. This paper seeks
   to improve understanding of the current state of knowledge by reviewing
   the content of 43 research articles. A framework is developed that
   differentiates research activity according to a lifecycle model that
   incorporates financial needs, design, adoption and impact. The review
   finds that research to date has resulted in a high level of
   practitioner involvement, providing valuable links from the mobile
   phone industry to the research community but, as a consequence,
   research has become too narrowly defined. Thus, issues of assessing
   financial need and the measurement of impact have been comparatively
   neglected, while application design and adoption studies have received
   greater attention. This paper suggests a future direction for research
   and practice within the mainstream of micro-financial services and
   finance for the poor, correcting this imbalance, and contributing
   towards the mobiles-in-development-research agenda.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the determinants of disparities in coverage by
   cell telephone systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. It uses a spatially
   disaggregated probit for over 990,000 grid cells with adjustments for
   spatial autocorrelation. Determinants include potential market size
   (population); cost factors related to accessibility (elevation, slope,
   distance from a main road, and distance from the nearest large city);
   and competition policy. Estimates indicate significant results for the
   supply-demand variables, and very strong results for the competition
   policy index.
   Simulations suggest that a generalized improvement in competition
   policy could lead to huge improvements in cell phone area coverage, and
   to an overall coverage increase of nearly 100\%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Mobile Phone Diffusion and Corruption in Africa}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL COMMUNICATION}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{333-353}},
Abstract = {{The explosion of mobile phones into a region that, until recently, was
   nearly devoid of telecommunications infrastructure provides a valuable
   opportunity to explore the potential effects of information and
   communication technology on various economic and social outcomes. This
   article focuses specifically on the potential influence that mobile
   phones will exert on corruption in Africa. Two distinct empirical
   analyses test the hypothesis that mobile phones will reduce corruption
   in Africa, as a result of decentralizing information and communication
   and thereby diminishing the opportunities available to engage in
   corruption as well as increasing the potential of detection and
   punishment. The results of a fixed effects regression of panel data at
   the country level reveal a significant negative correlation between a
   country's degree of mobile phone penetration and that country's level
   of perceived corruption. In addition to this, a multivariate regression
   of survey data reveals that the degree of mobile phone signal coverage
   across 13 Namibian provinces is significantly associated with reduced
   perceptions of corruption at the individual level.}},

  abstract={Much has been written about the impacts of information and communication technology (ICT) in Africa and its transformational socio-economic potential. The penetration of mobile phones in particular has been particularly marked in recent years. This paper seeks to interrogate the hypothesis of transformation by examining the ways in which Africa is integrated into global mobile phone value chain, and the uses to which this technology is put on the continent. While mobiles are having significant, and sometimes welfare enhancing impacts, their use is also embedded in existing relations of social support, resource extraction and conflict. Consequently their impacts are dialectical, facilitating change but also reinforcing existing power relations. As Africa is still primarily a user, rather than a producer or creator of ICT, this represents a form of thin integration (â€œthintegrationâ€) into the global economy, which does not fundamentally alter the continentâ€™s dependent position.},
